# Bladeborne
This is for my GADV Project

## Description
This is a school project for my Game Development (GADV) module. This is my first time using Unity, so this is not meant to be a very good game... I'm mostly experimenting with some of Unity's features.

## Background Information
This game is set in a world where global warming has worsened and the climate on earth becomes extremely hot. But thanks to this new material called “Polithium” that started growing and absorbs the heat energy around it, the temperature on earth could be kept cool enough for humans to survive. On top of that, due to the vast amounts of energy absorbed by the Polithium crystals, humans can use it as their main source of energy and allowed civilization to reach new heights. However, many animals have been consuming these crystals, causing them to mutate and grow larger. These creatures are violent and powerful, so the humans must slay them to keep their population at bay and protect themselves. <br>
You play as one of these hunters, waking up in a mysterious ruin. It appears to be abandoned, could something have happened that caused the people living there to flee? Despite being abandoned, there are still some Polithium residuals left. You managed to get a Polithium powered teleporter to work, using it as a way to travel to various locations to hunt monsters in order to make a living from selling the Polithium energy harvested from the slayed monsetrs. 

## Instructions
Upon launching the game and pressing "Play", you will be brought the the Spawn Area (The Abandoned Ruin). There, going to the teleporter will allow you to go to the first level (Grasslands). <br>
When in the first level, your objective is to locate and slay the Scorchtail. <br>
Good luck!
